## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept           | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Fields are `private`; access is controlled through methods. |
| **Abstraction**   | Classes model real-world entities (Book, User, Library). |
| **Inheritance**   | Extendable for types like `StudentUser`, `ReferenceBook`, etc. |
| **Polymorphism**  | Can override methods for custom behavior in extended classes. |
| **Constructor Chaining** | Can be demonstrated by calling constructors using `this()` or `super()` in extended classes. |
